In conclusion, while Ordinals minimize UTXO bloat through Taproot’s efficient data storage, they still contribute to blockchain growth. The debate around Ordinals and Runes shows a clear divide: some believe these innovations detract from Bitcoin’s original vision of peer-to-peer cash, causing higher fees and slower speeds. On the other hand, others are optimistic, focusing on Bitcoin’s potential to outshine competitors like Ethereum and Solana. These features could lead to significant returns, though speculative projects, especially in the meme sector, might not have long-term staying power. 
I see similar patterns emerging in Kaspa with KRC20 and KRC721, where early hype increases popularity and rewards for miners. However, meme tokens are also starting to flood the market, with some in the community concerned that these projects stray from Kaspa's core purpose. I believe KRC20 and KRC721 are just the beginning, paving the way for more practical applications. As Kaspa’s technology grows, I’m hopeful industries like finance, healthcare, and utilities will embrace Kaspa’s decentralized, tamper-proof solutions. Imagine a world where banks and other sectors rely on Kaspa to store and verify data securely, free from manipulation—a future I’m excited to see unfold.
